  sentences:
  - Excellent form, Commander!
  - Another strategy we use is Ravenous Consumption, also known as absorbing elements,
    Sir!
  - This will create a shield around yourself, Sir!
  - If this shield blocks an attack, it consumes one of your gathered bones and your
    attacks will be empowered for a while, Sir!
  - Try it out, along with all the other techniques you have learned, on this set
    of dwarves, Sir!
