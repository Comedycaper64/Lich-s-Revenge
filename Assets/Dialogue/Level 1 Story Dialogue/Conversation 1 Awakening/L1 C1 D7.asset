  sentences:
  - Please, my love, calm yourself. Forgive me for speaking out of turn, but I cannot
    abide to see you so upset.
  - Fortunately, I do have at least some good news. The scouts reported that the
    dwarves are still in the early preparations of their assault.
  - I estimate that if we leave at dawn, we should be able to reach Col Vexirn and
    confront Alaric before he can mobilise his armies.
