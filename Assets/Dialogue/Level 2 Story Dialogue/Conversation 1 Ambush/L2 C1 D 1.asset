  - With the news that the dwarves were preparing another invasion ringing around
    his skull, the Lich set out to Col Vexirn the next morning to confront the Dwarf
    King Alaric, his loyal companion Marrow with him every step of the way.

    display of tactical genius, the dwarves had set up an ambush in Mendime Marsh!
