  sentences:
  - Many years ago, a terrible calamity struck the Kingdom of the Dead. A destructive
    earthquake, likely summoned by powerful dwarven sorcerers, tore through the land
    and marked the start of an onslaught of attacks.
  - The Lich, with the aid of his trusty esquire, Marrow, guided his armies through
    many fierce battles with the dwarves of Col Vexirn, ultimately leading the Kingdom
    to victory.
  - "As his loyal subjects rejoiced, however, the Lich was distracted by other matters.
    As Marrow watched his master\u2019s prowess on the battlefield, he soon became
    enraptured by him, and, at the end of the final battle, finally confessed his
    feelings."
  - As the embers of love began to burn in cold, undead hearts, the Lich and his
    squire soon fell madly in love with one another, and hoped to cherish a long,
    happy undeath together.
  - Alas, their days of courtship were cut short by a troubling development. A mere
    month after their first date, the Lich received a message from Marrow, summoning
    him to the dungeons.
