  sentences:
  - Having narrowly escaped the oddly coordinated attack, the Lich and his squire
    travelled onwards at double speed, only stopping occasionally for short, romantic
    rest breaks under the stars.
  - They soon reached the High Peaks, and began making their way through Clainthrod
    Pass towards the capital, hoping to confront the Dwarf King Alaric and make him
    pay, putting an end to this battle once and for all.
  - Mere hours into their travels through the mountains, however, the pair once again
    encountered a band of dwarves.
  - Unlike the skeletons, they were prepared for battle, and it would take great
    strength and cunning from the Lich to push through their defences.
