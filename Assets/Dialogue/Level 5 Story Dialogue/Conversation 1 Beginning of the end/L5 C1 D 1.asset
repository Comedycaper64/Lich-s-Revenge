  sentences:
  - 'With the Dwarf King defeated, the Lich stood triumphant. The threat of the dwarves
    had been eradicated, and soon, they would be raised as new soldiers for his army
    and bow to him as their new king. '
  - "Rejoicing in his success, the Lich turned to celebrate with his beloved\u2026
    however, Marrow was strangely absent. Scanning the room, the Lich saw no sign
    of the squire."
  - Perhaps he had simply gotten lost, or was preparing a special surprise for him?
    He began to wander the eerily silent halls of the palace, his boney feet clacking
    noisily against the stone as he passed through many chambers and dungeons, hunting
    for his partner.
  - 'At last, he came to a large set of sturdy oaken doors, covered with dwarvish
    runes. If he could, he would have taken a deep breath as he pushed the doors
    open and stepped into a throne room. '
  - Relief washed over him as he saw his beloved Marrow. However, this relief quickly
    shifted to unease as the squire remained motionless and silent, his back to him.
  - As the Lich stepped forward after a few moments of hesitation, Marrow finally
    spoke, his voice cold as he practically spat the words out.
