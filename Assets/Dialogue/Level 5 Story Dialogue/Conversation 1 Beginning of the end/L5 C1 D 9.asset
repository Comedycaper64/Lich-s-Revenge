  sentences:
  - Yes, it was I who summoned that earthquake.
  - 'It was I who lied to the dwarves about our mines being abandoned. '
  - It was I who informed the Dwarf King you would be coming to attack him.
  - Why?
  - "You are weak, my \u201CKing\u201D. Your armies were stagnating, and so too was
    our Kingdom."
  - If you had your way, you would be happy for us to spend the next millennium hiding
    in the shadows underground.
  - I will not abide by that.
  - Under my rule, our Kingdom shall prosper, and all the living creatures in the
    realm will cower and grovel before us, their rightful masters!
  - I will rule over all.
  - Now, relinquish your title and bow before your new King!
