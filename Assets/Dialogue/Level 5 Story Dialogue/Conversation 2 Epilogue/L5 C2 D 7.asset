  sentences:
  - Shocked to see the skeleton of the former Dwarf King at his door, the Lich hesitated
    for a moment before letting him in. However, it was not long before tensions
    eased.
  - The pair spent hours simply talking about what had happened (or rather, Alaric
    spent hours simply talking about what had happened, while the Lich listened,
    nodding in understanding).
  - Alaric explained that he had been raised as a skeleton to join the army but,
    over time, began to regain his memories.
  - "He made it clear that he did not blame the Lich; after all, he too had been
    tricked by Marrow. In fact, he saw the Lich\u2019s determination to protect his
    people as very admirable."
  - Plus, being undead was not nearly as unpleasant as he thought it would be - he
    and the other dwarves that were raised were happy in their new home and, given
    the circumstances, could not have asked for more.
  - 'The Lich, previously alone, ashamed and grieving, very much appreciated the
    company. '
  - 'Over the coming months, Alaric regularly visited the Lich. The dwarf taught
    him the ways of his people and, in turn, he taught the dwarf the ways of the
    undead. '
  - 'The pair formed a strong friendship and a special bond, built on the forgiveness
    for the transgressions that they had both been tricked into committing. '
  - And then, one morning, after a particularly late night of drinking, the Lich
    awoke on the sofa, cuddled up to the skeletal dwarf.
  - "As the feeling of butterflies welled up in his ribcage, the Lich smiled. Yes,
    perhaps he could love again\u2026"
