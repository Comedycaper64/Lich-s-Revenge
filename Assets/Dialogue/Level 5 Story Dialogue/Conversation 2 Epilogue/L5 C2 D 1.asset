  sentences:
  - With Marrow defeated and his machinations destroyed, the Lich should have felt
    pride.
  - 'However, as he stood, battered and exhausted, looking at the body of the one
    he trusted most, he felt the bitterness of betrayal dissolve away, leaving a
    hollowness inside him. '
  - "The Lich\u2019s return to the Kingdom of the Dead was uneventful."
  - "When news spread of their master\u2019s return, the people rejoiced. \u201CThe
    dwarves have been defeated! Our people are saved! Long unlive the King!\u201D"
  - 'For weeks, the Lich sat locked in his chambers, processing it all. How could
    he have been so foolish? '
  - He had truly loved Marrow, and that love had blinded him to the truth, almost
    costing him everything. Indeed, he did not think he could ever love again.
  - "Until one day, there was a knock at the door\u2026"
