  sentences:
  - A dwarf speaking the tongue of the undead is a most unusual sight indeed, but
    it was what she said that was truly alarming.
  - The Lich was only able to hear but a few words before the dwarf was incinerated
    by powerful magic of an unknown origin.
  - Perhaps the gods were angry at her for daring to surrender to an evil as great
    as an undead overlord, or perhaps there was something more sinister pulling the
    strings behind the scenes.
  - Only time would tell as Marrow and the Lich set off on the final part of their
    journey towards Col Vexirn.
