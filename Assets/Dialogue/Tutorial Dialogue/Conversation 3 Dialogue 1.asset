  sentences:
  - I see you're scavenging the duergar's bodies for all they're worth...
  - Those bones can certainly come in handy, especially if you're taken a hit or
    two.
  - Don't forget to HEAL, dying again isn't too pleasant.
  - Though maybe now isn't the best time, there's a Mana Fountain just on the right.
  - A quick drink from them should revitalise you immediately...
  - ...they even let you rise again, should you fall.
  - That's all from me... your other minions have been dying to see you!
